Personal Files for my Flipper Zero.

If you want to use anything here, just copy it to your own folder of the same name on your Flipper's SD card.

No online databases are reuploaded here (seriously stop doing this people), and I don't share IR or Sub-Ghz files that I use personally: this repo mostly contains UI customizations and diagrams that I keep saved for reference.

Some files may require minor edits in order to compensate for not including my databases (ie. remove my bike lock and TV remote from the favorites.txt).
You want to copy these to your SD using a card reader instead of the Flipper, or it will take forever.

If I upload your work here and you want credit, please message me and let me know.
